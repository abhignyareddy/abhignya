### THE SOFT SKILLS ASSESSED BY THE HUNT
#1 For the questions 1 and 3, a person should have general knowledge or should possess logical skills to get answer from the clues.
#2 For the question 2, a person must have deep understanding skills.
#3 For the question 4,A person should have strong knowledge on decoding skills.
#4 For the question 5,it is based on thinking skills but it is not related to the last question.It is given to confuse or forget the previous answers.So A person can answer question 6 if he would remember all the first 4 answers after solving fifth question.So he must have good memory.

### POSSIBLE WAY TO SOLVE HUNT
Answer all the questions correctly and reach the last question.

### DEAD-ENDS
Answering any question wrong will be a dead-end and exit of the game.

### STEPS TO SET UP THE PROJECT

# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
# Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
# `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
# `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
# `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
# `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
